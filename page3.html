        <p class="text3">Hi all,

            As discussed and voted on we have moved office hours to be on Mondays and Wednesday’s from now on starting today.
            
            The office hours will be from 4:30 until 6PM. You are not required to show up for this time. If you have any questions about assignments or materials feel free to drop in at any time during that window. You also don’t need to stay for the whole time, you can come and ask your question and leave right after it is answered if you want.
            
            Thanks,
            Alex 
        </p>
