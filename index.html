        <p class="text1"> Now that we understand some of the layout based HTML tags and CSS rules, let's try to build a simple site that creates a more complicated layout.

 

            Use your projectStarter script to create a simple static website skeleton
            Create a new GitHub repository, initialize the new local project to be a local Git repository and connect them using the workflows found in assignment W2B and W2C
            Using some simple layout tags and rules, create one of the three layouts provided in class without using floats or grid or position!
            You will have to use the simple layout CSS rules
            Note: Do not worry about any screen size other than desktop (don't worry about phone or tablet sized screens, just make it work on your screen)
            Add, commit with the message "Added multi-column layout" and push your simple site to GitHub
            To submit, please enter the URL for your new repository. </p>
